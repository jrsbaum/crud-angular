# MyCrudApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.3.
I made this project to learn how a CRUD works. For educational purposes only, I used a fake REST API to simulate my backend.
As I learn about how Angular works, I add things to it.

## Install JSON-Server

Run `npm install -g json-server` <br>
Create file db.json <br>
Start JSON-Server with `json-server --watch db.json`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help
